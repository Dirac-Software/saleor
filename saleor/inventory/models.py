"""
A PurchaseOrder is created when we confirm we will order some products from a supplier.
We create the corresponding PurchaseOrderItems at the same time.
We can add an Invoice using the Xero invoice id to a PurchaseOrder to get payment data

Stock must exist in a nonowned warehouse correlating to the supplier we buy the stock
from.

On confirmation of a purchase order stock is moved to owned warehouses and Orders that
are using stock from the nonowned warehouse are reallocated from the moved stock in FIFO
priority. Purchase order confirmation occurs _before_ products arrive in the destination warehouse.

When we allocate stock to orders from owned warehouses, we create AllocationSources and
update the POI quantity_allocated.

On Shipment arrival we create a Receipt. After receipt confirmation, we allocate
PurchaseOrderItemAdjustment ( POIA ) to account for changes in the quantity of stock
from this purchase order compared to what we expected.

Currently we don't track VAT (it is all reclaimed anyway). This means the cash flow
isn't fully accurate.

TODO: add a celery task to check the Stock is as expected every evening.
