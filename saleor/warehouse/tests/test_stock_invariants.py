"""Dedicated tests for the Stock ↔ POI invariants in owned warehouses.

THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL INVARIANTS:

1. Total Physical Stock - conservation of mass:
    Stock.quantity == sum(POI.quantity_ordered + processed_adjustments - POI.quantity_fulfilled)

    For any (owned_warehouse, variant) pair, Stock.quantity represents physical stock
    currently in the warehouse. This equals what we received from suppliers (quantity_ordered
    + adjustments) minus what we've shipped to customers (quantity_fulfilled).

    Note: POI.quantity_received is just an audit trail showing what initially arrived.
    The actual stock is always based on quantity_ordered + processed_adjustments - quantity_fulfilled.
    Only processed adjustments (processed_at != NULL) are included.

2. Allocation Tracking - AllocationSources link Stock to POI batches:
    Stock.quantity_allocated == sum(POI.quantity_allocated)

    For owned warehouses, AllocationSources ensure that Stock.quantity_allocated
    always matches the sum of POI.quantity_allocated across all active POIs.

3. Fulfillment Tracking - FulfillmentSources provide audit trail:
    sum(FulfillmentSource.quantity) == sum(POI.quantity_fulfilled)

    When items are fulfilled, AllocationSources are converted to FulfillmentSources
    and POI.quantity_fulfilled is incremented.

DERIVED RELATIONSHIP (follows mathematically from the above):
    Available stock: Stock.quantity - Stock.quantity_allocated == sum(POI.available_quantity)
    Where POI.available_quantity = (quantity_ordered + processed_adjustments - quantity_allocated - quantity_fulfilled)

Any time an invariant is violated we should add a test here. We should also regularly
run an invariant validation to make sure the Stock is in the correct state.
